#         #3. Explanation of Steps

# Checkout repository: This step pulls the latest version of your code.

# Cache dependencies: This caches the dependencies (in this example, npm modules) to speed up future runs.

# The path specifies where the dependencies are stored.

# The key is used to create a unique cache. In this case, it combines the OS and a hash of your package-lock.json file. If the file changes, the cache will be considered invalid and rebuilt.

# restore-keys is like a fallback in case the exact cache key isn’t found (e.g., if you change a dependency).

# Install dependencies: This installs the dependencies, but only if they aren’t found in the cache.

# Prime Cache: This step will output the result of whether the cache was a hit (i.e., found) or miss (i.e., not found).
